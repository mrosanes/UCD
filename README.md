# UCD Project

UCD Project: (Sub)Stellar object emission in Radio waves. This project allows to compute the Radio Emission produced 
by a given (sub)stellar object, which can be an Ultra-Cool Dwarf or stellar objects with bigger dimensions. The 
research is especially focused in the gyrosynchrotron emission caused by charged particles spiralling along the 
magnetic field lines of the (sub)stellar object. The objects studied in this project are objects with strong magnetic 
fields (eg: Bp > 1000 Gauss).

The model developed in this project is based on the pipeline described in:
